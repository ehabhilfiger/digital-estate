    Every component, meticulously calculated.
    Every animation, precisely timed.
    Every line of code... part of the plan."

   THE MISSION
   ================================================================ */

   Data sovereignty for those who refuse to kneel before Big Tech.
   Zero-trust networks for those who understand true security.
   On-premises AI for those who value confidential intelligence.

   "I am justice. I am control. I am your infrastructure."

/* ================================================================
   THANKS
   ================================================================ */

   To those who seek privacy in an age of surveillance.
   To those who demand ownership in an age of subscriptions.
   To those who build rather than rent.

   The new world begins with sovereign infrastructure.
