## üìß Email Integration (Optional - 15 Minutes)

### Option A: Resend (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Sign up for Resend** (free tier: 3,000 emails/month)
   - Go to: https://resend.com
   - Create account
   - Get API key from dashboard

2. **Install Resend**
   ```bash
   npm install resend
   ```

3. **Add to Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # In Vercel dashboard or .env.local
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_here
   FROM_EMAIL=ehab@backupestate.vercel.app
   ```

4. **Verify Domain** (optional but recommended)
   - Add DNS records in Vercel/Cloudflare
   - Or use Resend's free `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing

5. **Uncomment Email Code**
   - Open: `app/api/assessment/submit/route.ts`
   - Find the `sendEmailNotification` function
   - Uncomment the Resend code block (lines 85-100)

### Option B: SendGrid, Postmark, or Mailgun
Similar setup - install their SDK and replace the email sending logic.

---

## üîî Slack Notifications (Optional - 5 Minutes)

Get instant alerts when hot leads complete the assessment.

### Setup:
1. **Create Slack Webhook**
   - Go to: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
   - Create webhook for your channel (e.g., #leads or #sales)
   - Copy webhook URL

2. **Add to Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
   ```

3. **Redeploy**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

You'll now get notifications like:
```
üî• HOT LEAD ALERT
Email: prospect@company.com
Score: 168
Tier: Estate Command Center
Risk Level: CRITICAL
Urgency: critical
Budget: $250k-$1M
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è CRM Integration (Optional - Varies)

### Generic Webhook (Easiest)
Most CRMs support webhook integrations (Zapier, Make.com, etc.)

1. **Create Zapier/Make webhook**
2. **Add to environment:**
   ```bash
   CRM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url
   ```
3. **Uncomment CRM code** in `route.ts` (line 62)

### Direct Integration (Advanced)
For HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive:
- Install their SDK
- Use their API directly
- See their docs for lead creation

Example data sent:
```json
{
  "email": "prospect@company.com",
  "leadScore": 168,
  "tier": "estate",
  "riskLevel": "CRITICAL",
  "urgency": "critical",
  "vertical": "legal",
  "budget": "250k-1m",
  "currentSpend": 300000,
  "projectedSavings": 525000,
  "salesPriority": "HOT"
}
```

## üìà Analytics Tracking (Recommended)

Add event tracking to measure funnel:

```typescript
// In assessment page
useEffect(() => {
  // Track assessment start
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('event', 'assessment_started');
  }
}, []);

// Track completion
useEffect(() => {
  if (showResults && typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('event', 'assessment_completed', {
      tier: results.tier,
      score: results.totalScore,
      risk: results.riskLevel
    });
  }
}, [showResults]);
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Assessment not loading?
- Check browser console for errors

### Email not sending?

- Verify `FROM_EMAIL` domain is verified

### Slack not notifying?
- Test webhook URL directly with curl
- Check Slack webhook configuration
- Verify `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` env var is set

### Lead score seems wrong?
